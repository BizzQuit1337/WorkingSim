#### Technically working random life sim ####
#Author: Albert Brown

## starts with a number of organisms and food you can decide in the source code

each organism has stats dictated by its colored cells and will live for around 
20 seconds depending on its stats and if it eats enough food it passes its 
composition onto the next generation.

You can make custom creatures. You can decide there stats via colors but there other starts
like health and movement are set to defaults 

theres are a lot of bugs but they just add to the evolution of the creatures XD
